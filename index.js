//Write a block of code that takes numbers and console log the sum of its cubes.
let power = 3;          //creating and asigning the power var, I have made this a variable so it can be easily changed
let cube1 = 1**power;   //creaating and calculating the 1st cubed var
let cube2 = 5**power;   //2nd cubed var
let cube3 = 9**power;   //3rd cubed var

console.log(cube1 + cube2 + cube3); //adding and printing the total sum of the 3 cubed var's

//you can also do this in one line for fun

console.log((1**3)+(5**3)+(9**3));  //Brackets are needed so the cubed numbers are cubed and THEN added
